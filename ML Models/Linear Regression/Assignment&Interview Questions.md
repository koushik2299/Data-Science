**Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.**

**Linear regression :** Fitting a straight line to match the pattern of the data for which it could be referenced for predicting new data points 

**Simple Linear Regression:**
- If there is only one Independent Variable and one Dependent Variable, it is known as simple linear regression.
- Example: Predicting Rent of the house based on Square feet of the Home.

**Multiple Linear Regression:**
- If there are multiple Independent Variables and one Dependent Variable, it is known as Multiple Linear regression.
- Example: Predicting Rent of the home by Square feet, Average income of the Locations, GDP.



**Question 2: Assumptions of Linear Regression:**

1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be approximately linear.

2. **Independence of Errors:** The errors (residuals) in the model should be independent of each other.

3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables.

4. **Normality of Errors:** The errors should be normally distributed.

5. **No or Little Multicollinearity:** There should be no or little multicollinearity among the independent variables.

6. **No Endogeneity:** The independent variables are not influenced by the errors.

7. **No Heteroscedasticity:** The spread of residuals should be consistent across the independent variables.
